            <p class="client-part-haead wow fadeInDown delay-05 animated" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInDown;">The Nakshibendi Tarikat is the Most Distinguished of the Sufi Paths to Allah. This distinction comes from its nisbat (spiritual lineage) coming through the Closest Friend of Prophet Muhammad (AS), Hazrat Abu Bakr el-Siddiq. The Nakshibendi Way has been passed through the Masters known as the Khwajagan through the centuries. In this last era, the Secret of the Nakshibendi Way was entrusted to Sultan el-Evliya Sheykh Mevlana Muhammad Nazil Adil el-Hakkani el-Kibrisi.</p> 

            

            <p class="client-part-haead wow fadeInDown delay-05 animated" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInDown;">In the late 1970s, Sultan el-Evliya dressed one of his closest murids, Sheykh Abdul Kerim el-Kibrisi el-Rabbani, with the permission of Khilafat and sent him to the United States to represent him and plant the flag of the Nakshibendi Way. Sheykh Abdul Kerim, who was conferred the Spiritual Title of Sahib el-Sayf by his Master, worked tirelessly to spread the pure teachings of the Holy Prophet and the Nakshibendi Masters in America, during a time of racism and social upheaval.</p>  



            <p class="client-part-haead wow fadeInDown delay-05 animated" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInDown;">In 2002, his spiritual mission culminated in the establishment of the Osmanli Nakshibendi Dergahi in Upstate New York. A Der-gah is a Threshold to the Divine Presence. In the tradition of the Nakshibendi Sheykhs and the Ottoman Sultans, Sahib el-Sayf founded the Osmanli Dergahi as a place for those seeking the Truth to live a Prophetic lifestyle.</p> 



            <p class="client-part-haead wow fadeInDown delay-05 animated" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInDown;">One of those chosen to be trained at the Osmanli Dergahi and be dressed in the Majesty of the Nakshibendi Masters was Sheykh Lokman Efendi. Immediately upon taking initiation with Sahib el-Sayf, Shekyh Lokman Efendi was bestowed the title of Vekil, or Representative. And for over fifteen years, he represented Sahib el-Sayf in every sense of the word. When Sahib el-Sayf was imprisoned by the Turkish government for wearing a Turban and gathering in the Remembrance of Allah, Sheykh Lokman Efendi preserved his spiritual community in America. In 2012, Sahib el-Sayf was called from this earthly abode to the Presence of his Lord to prepare the universes for the coming of Mahdi (AS). Since that time, Sheykh Lokman Efendi has taken up the mantle of Sahib el-Sayf, with the permission and instruction of Sahib el-Sayf himself, as well as Sultan el-Evliya.</p>



            <p class="client-part-haead wow fadeInDown delay-05 animated" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInDown;">Sheykh Lokman Efendi has dedicated his life to the teaching of the Osmanli Nakshibedi Way, and to the revival of the hearts of the people of the End Times, to prepare them for the appearance of the Master of the Age, Muhammad Mahdi (AS).</p>

He traces his lineage to the Holy Prophet (S), as well as to Shaykh Abdul Qadir Gilani (KS) and Mevlana Jelaleddin Rumi (KS), among other saints. At a young age, he became the murid of Sultan ul Awliya Shaykh Abdullah Faiz al Dagestani (KS). He stayed in his association in Damascus, and was eventually ordered to return to Cyprus to spread the teachings of the Naksibendi Way. After the passing of Shaykh Mawlana Abdullah (KS), Shaykh Mawlana Nazim (KS) became the Inheritor and Grandshaykh of the Tariqah. He spread Islam and Tariqah throughout the world, but most notably in Europe and America, awakening the hearts of the West to the Light of Islam. In 1976, he sent Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi al Rabbani (KS) to the United States to be his First Khalifa in that country. He maintained a humble and simple life at his Dergah in Lefke, Cyprus, hosting and taking care of his millions of murids throughout the world. He was veiled from this earthly realm in 2014.</p>

                <p>Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi al Rabbani (KS) is the Leader of the Osmanli Naksibendi Hakkani Tarikat. Born in 1957 to a family descending from the Holy Prophet (S) and the Ottoman Sultans, Shaykh Abdulkerim (KS) spent the early part of his life in the village of Alifodes, founded by his grandfather. His father and grandfather were murids of Shaykh Abdullah Dagestani (KS) andthe earliest supporters of Shaykh Mawlana Nazim in Cyprus. When Greek attacks began upon the Cypriot Turkish population, his family became muhajirs and migrated to the city of Famagusta. There, he was constantly in the sohbah of Shaykh Mawlana Nazim, particularly in the Lala Mustafa Pasa Camii and the Famagusta Dergah which was maintained by Shaykh Abdulkerim’s father, Sayyid Haji Fuat al Rabbani. In 1974, war broke out in Cyprus. Shaykh Abdulkerim (KS) volunteered in the army and was wounded in battle, thus receiving the title of Ghazi. He formed part of the vanguard that ultimately recaptured the city of Famagusta. In 1976, he was sent by Shaykh Mawlana Nazim to the United States to be his First Khalifa there. In America, Shaykh Abdulkerim (KS) was constantly reaching out to the people through the beautiful manners of Islam and the Ottomans; thousands became Muslim at his hands. In 2003, Shaykh Mawlana Nazim bestowed Shaykh Abdulkerim with a special flag and instructed him to open the Osmanli Naksibendi Hakkani Way. That same year, Shaykh Abdulkerim established the Osmanli Dergahi in Upstate New York. Shaykh Abdulkerim always stood up for Shariah and Hakk, never fearing to speak the Truth whether to governments, religious officials, or the general public. He spread the teachings of the Osmanli Naksibendi Hakkani Way all over the world, establishing Dergahs in Turkey, India, China, Peru, and Germany, among other countries. In 2012, he was veiled from this world while visiting Shaykh Mawlana in Cyprus. Shaykh Mawlana stated that Shaykh Abdulkerim did not die, but was in fact veiled and would return in the time of Mahdi (AS). Before passing, Shaykh Abdulkerim designated Shaykh Lokman Efendi to be his Inheritor and carry on the mission in his absence.</p>

                 <h3 style="color: white"> Sheykh Lokman Efendi </h3>

                <p>Shaykh Lokman Efendi is the Khalifa of Sahib al Sayf Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi al Rabbani. As stated by Shaykh Abdulkerim, Shaykh Lokman is a descendent of Holy Prophet (S), Prophet Suleyman (AS), and the Ottoman Awliya who originallybrought Islam to Southeast Asia. Shaykh Lokman was raised in Singapore in a simple, humble upbringing. In 1996, he came to the United States with the goal of finding a Shaykh. In 1999, he met Shaykh Abdulkerim at his Dergah in Manhattan.</p>

                 <p>Soon after, Shaykh Abdulkerim ordered Lokman Efendi to accompany him to London to meet Shaykh Mawlana. When introducing Lokman Efendi to Sultan ul Awliya, Shaykh Abdulkerim said, “this is my Khalifa.” Shaykh Mawlana gave ijazah, prayed upon Lokman Efendi and accepted him. After this meeting Shaykh Abdulkerim asked, “do you know what just happened?” Knowing the immensity of his duty and out of humility, Lokman Efendi asked, “may I not accept?” Shaykh Abdulkerim replied, “it is not a matter of choice, this is what has been written. In the future, you will be my mouth that speaks”.  After returning to America, Shaykh Abdulkerim informed the Zikr Circle that Lokman Efendi was his Khalifa.  He also bestowed upon him the title of “Khwaja.”</p>

                <p>During Shaykh Abdulkerim’s life, Khwaja Lokman was his Representative in every situation. In his absence, he would maintain the Upstate Dergah as well as the Dergah in Manhattan. Shaykh Abdulkerim also instructed Khwaja Lokman Efendi to open his own Dergah in Harlem, where he was given full authority to give sohbet and train murids on the path of Suluk. The murids from all over the world would consult with Khwaja Lokman for advice in how to progress and be in the service of Shaykh Abdulkerim. The Shaykh said that Khwaja Lokman was a dervish, because he had forsaken all worldly attachment for the service of his Shaykh.</p>

                <p>Shortly before his veiling, Sahib al Sayf Shaykh Abdulkerim gathered some of the murids at the Dergah in the courtyard. He said, “when I am not here, everyone must follow Lokman. Even if you think he is doing wrong, you still must follow him.” Before leaving the Dergah for the last time, Shaykh Abdulkerim bid farewell to the murids and thanked them individually for their service. At the end of this address, he said, “Lokman Khwaja, I don’t have to mention his name. Leave him out. I am thanking him especially, that he is always covering my place when I am not around. He is covering in every way, alhamdilullah. So many trying to not to respect his rights but you should because he is also in very high station. He is not showing. He doesn’t know so many things (about his own high station), but it is okay. Nobody has to know anything yet.”</p>

                <p>After Shaykh Abdulkerim was veiled on June 30, 2012, the senior members of the Jamaat immediately renewed their bayah with Khwaja Lokman, in accordance with the order of Sahib al Sayf Shaykh Abdulkerim. Despite the fitna that started to spread, Khwaja Lokman kept the Jamaat together. Since the passing of Sahib al Sayf Shaykh Abdulkerim, Khwaja Lokman has spread the teachings of the Osmanli Naksibendi Way throughout the world, bringing countless more into this blessed Way.</p>

What is Tariqah?</a></h4><div id="collapse0" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body "></div><p class="frequent-questions-haead">The Arabic word for Sufism, Tasawwuf, is derived from the title Ashab al-Suffa, or the People of the Bench. The People of the Bench were a group of Companions of the Holy Prophet (S) who dedicated their entire life to service. They left behind their worldly lives, and spent their time living in the shade of the Prophet’s Masjid, on a bench, hence their title. They were constantly in the presence of the Holy Prophet (S) and immersed themselves in his Association. They had no fame, worldly power, or wealth; they only sought servanthood. Their spiritual rank derived from their immediate service to the Holy Prophet (S) and his Way. Sufism is to follow in their footsteps.
The literal meaning of the word Tariqah is, the Way. The Tariqah within Sufism is a Way through which a spiritual seeker, or murid, may progress on the spiritual path. There are Forty One main Tariqahs in the Islamic Tradition; Forty of these are derived from Hz. Ali al-Murtaza (KW), the cousin of the Holy Prophet (S). These include the Qadiri, Shadhili, Rifai, and Jerrahi Ways. As for our Way, the Most Distinguished Osmanli Naksibendi Hakkani Order, it is the only Way that traces its lineage through Hz. Abu Bakr as-Siddik (RA), the closest companion of the Holy Prophet (S) and his Companion in the Cave. We hope to tread upon the Path of Sufism upon the Tarikat of the great Masters of the Spirit.</p><p class="frequent-questions-haead"></p></div></div></div></div><div class="panel-group" id="accordian"> <div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> <a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="accordian" data-target="#collapse1">- What is a Shaykh and why do we need one?</a></h4><div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body "></div><p class="frequent-questions-haead">A Shaykh is a Spiritual Guide. For one who hopes to embark upon the Sufi Path, he must have a Guide. Because the central tenant of Tarikat is to fight against the ego. Without a Shaykh, a man will be tricked by his ego into thinking he is purifying himself, when he is in fact headed toward deviation. One of the Great Grandshaykhs of the Naksibendi Way, Hz. Bayazid Bastami (KS) said, “He who has no Shaykh, his Shaykh is shaytan.” The meaning of this phrase is that without a Guide, a man will be led astray from the Path. The Shaykh is the one who knows the road ahead, and guides the murid away from the dangers on the road. The Shaykh in reality is an Inheritor of the Holy Prophet (S). As the tradition of the Holy Prophet (S) states, “The Shaykh in his community is like the Prophet among his Nation.” By sitting in association (sohbah) with the Shaykh, we emulate the Companions who sat in association with the Holy Prophet.</p><p class="frequent-questions-haead"></p></div></div></div></div><div class="panel-group" id="accordian"> <div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> <a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="accordian" data-target="#collapse2"> - What is Rabita?</a></h4><div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body "></div><p class="frequent-questions-haead">Rabita means to connect. One of the spiritual disciplines of the murids in the Naksibendi Order is to be in Rabita with their Shaykh. Our Guide, Sahib el-Sayf Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi al Rabbani (KS) has stated that the murid should not be tricked into turning the discipline of Rabita into an imaginary exercise. Rabita is developed through being in association with the Shaykh. When one leaves the presence of the Shaykh, he then constantly asks himself, “would my Shaykh be pleased if I did this action?” By always considering that he is in the presence of his Shaykh and maintaining adab (good manners) accordingly, the murid will develop Rabita with his Guide.
For the murid who is physically far from the Dergah, he can still make tafakkur and ask himself, “how would my Shaykh see this? How would he hear this? How would he say this?” Such a murid may also stay connected with the Shaykh by watching the live broadcasts regularly.</p><p class="frequent-questions-haead"></p></div></div></div></div><div class="panel-group" id="accordian"> <div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> <a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="accordian" data-target="#collapse3"> - Why is this tarikat based on sohbah?</a></h4><div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body "></div><p class="frequent-questions-haead">Every Tarikat has a Pir, or Founder. The Pir of our Tarikat, Shah Naksibend Muhammad al Uwaysi al Buhari (KS) said: Tariqatuna sohbah wa l-khayri fil jamia'.  Our Tarikat is based on Association and the goodness is found in the association.
Whereas other Tarikats may be based on Zikr, or Khalwat, or even music, the Naksibendi Way is founded upon Sohbah. This is because the Way of Sohbah most resembles the lifestyle of the Companions of the Holy Prophet (S). Just as their focus was on being in constant companionship with the Holy Prophet (S), through which they acquired knowledge, manners, and spirituality, the Naksibendi Masters teach their murids through association. Through association a murid is taught to be in constant awareness. Through association a murid acquires the good manners of his Shaykh. Through association a murid may understand the tricks and traps of his ego, and in so doing, progress on the Path.
Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi (KS) has said, the sohbah gives ammunition to the believer to fight against his ego and shaytan. The example of the one who listens to sohbet and the one who doesn’t is like two soldiers patrolling a border area. The one who listens to sohbet is like one who has bullets in his rifle to fight the enemy, whereas the other person has a rifle but no bullets; the rifle will only have a use if it is loaded. In the same way, the sohbah gives the murid the tools he needs to fight the dangers and traps he may encounter on the spiritual path; without the sohbah, the murid is lost.</p><p class="frequent-questions-haead"></p></div></div></div></div><div class="panel-group" id="accordian"> <div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> <a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="accordian" data-target="#collapse4">- Why is the main dergah based in upstate NY?</a></h4><div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body "></div><p class="frequent-questions-haead">The Merkez, or Center, of the Osmanli Dergah is located in Upstate New York because this location was chosen by Sahib al-Sayf Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi al Rabbani (KS) through Divine Inspiration. The Shaykh was given an order by Sultan ul Awliya Shaykh Mawlana Nazim al Kibrisi (KS)  to open an Osmanli Dergah in the United States. When searching for a location for the Dergah, Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi (KS) saw the Light of Grandshaykh Abdullah Faiz al Dagestani (KS) in the place that is now his Maqam. Holy Prophet (S) has stated that in the End of Times, the Sun will rise from the West. Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi (KS) explained this to mean that Islam will rise from the West in the End of Times. He has said repeatedly that the Osmanli Dergah will be one of the centers for Muhammad al Mahdi (AS) when he calls the Takbir.
At the age of 16, Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi (KS) was informed by Grandshaykh Abdullah Faiz al Dagestani (KS) that one day, he would open a continent in the West to Islam. The Osmanli Dergah in New York is a fulfillment of that inspiration.</p><p class="frequent-questions-haead"></p></div></div></div></div><div class="panel-group" id="accordian"> <div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> <a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="accordian" data-target="#collapse5">- What kind of Zikr is done in the Osmanli Naksibendi Way?</a></h4><div id="collapse5" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body "></div><p class="frequent-questions-haead">Sahib al Sayf Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi al Rabbani (KS) has taught his murids to make both the silent zikr and loud zikr. Silent Zikr has traditionally been the distinguishing feature of the Naksibendi Way. The murids of this Way make silent Zikr every night upon the Tasbih granted to Shaykh Abdulkerim by Shaykh Mawlana Nazim.
The Mujaddid of this Tarikat in this Century, Sultan al Awliya has revived the practice of loud Zikr amongst the Naksibendis as it was done by the earlier Khwajagan. Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi (KS) has said that the reason that the Masters of this Way, such as Imam Rabbani (KS), closed the practice of loud zikr is that it had become a vehicle of ostentation and showing off. Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi has said that today, the situation has reversed, and silent zikr has been misused for self-conceit, whereas loud Zikr is looked down upon. The Naksibendi Way is not static. It changes with the needs of the time. The people of Ahir Zaman have reached the lowest level of faith; the Loud Zikr serves as a shock to reawaken the hearts. Moreover, our Shaykh has used Loud Zikr as a Way to show the Living Power of Islam and attract people’s hearts to the Naksibendi Way. Silent Zikr is the distinguishing practice of the Naksibendi Way. This Loud Zikr is the Khatm-e-Khwajagan, which emulates the Zikr that was made by Holy Prophet (S) and Hz. Abu Bakr Siddiq (RA) in the Cave of Thawr. Loud Zikr is an established Sunnah, and in this End of Times, it gives energy and spiritual power to the murids for the time of Mahdi (AS).</p><p class="frequent-questions-haead"></p></div></div></div></div><div class="panel-group" id="accordian"> <div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> <a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="accordian" data-target="#collapse6">- What is Bay’ah? Is it necessary?</a></h4><div id="collapse6" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body "></div><p class="frequent-questions-haead">Bay’ah is a practice that was established by the Holy Prophet (S) and his Companions, which has been praised by Allah (SWT) in the Holy Quran. Allah (SWT) says in Surah al-Fath, “Certainly Allah was pleased with the believers when they gave bay’ah to you, [O Muhammad], under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest.” [Surah Al-Fath 48:18]. Bay’ah allows a Muslim to connect himself to this 1400 year old tradition. Our Shaykh is connected to the Holy Prophet (S) through a Golden Chain of his Inheritors. By giving Bay’ah to the Shaykh, a murid connects himself to this Golden Chain, thus placing himself under the protection and guidance of the Friends of Allah.</p><p class="frequent-questions-haead"></p></div></div></div></div><div class="panel-group" id="accordian"> <div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> <a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="accordian" data-target="#collapse7">- Why do we put emphasis on the Ottomans?</a></h4><div id="collapse7" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body "></div><p class="frequent-questions-haead">The Ottomans ruled over an Empire that was founded upon the Love of the Holy Prophet (S) and the Awliya. It was an Empire of Tarikat. Because of their dedication to the Sunnah and the Friends of Allah, the Ottoman Empire flourished for almost seven centuries. After the Righteous Khalifas, the Ottomans represented the most perfect manifestation of the Prophetic Way. Furthermore, the Ottomans always raised the banner of Justice. They gave the rights to all, whether they were Muslims or non-Muslims, Turks, Arabs, Jews, or Christians. The Ottomans represent the pinnacle of the joining of spiritual power and temporal power. Our hope is that by loving the Ottomans and following in their Way, we will be joined to them in the Ahiret.</p><p class="frequent-questions-haead"></p></div></div></div></div><div class="panel-group" id="accordian"> <div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> <a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="accordian" data-target="#collapse8">- What is our connection to Mahdi (AS)?</a></h4><div id="collapse8" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body "></div><p class="frequent-questions-haead">The belief that our Shaykh has taught us is that the world is in the period of time known as Akhir Zaman, or the End of Time. This is the time of tribulation and strife, when traditional morality will be upended. In this time, the dajjal, or anti-Christ, will emerge and spread his system across the world. Shaykh Mawlana and Shaykh Abdulkerim al Kibrisi have said that the system of dajjal has been established in this world, but that dajjal is waiting to reveal himself.
The hope of the believers lies in the promise of the Holy Prophet (S) who said that one of his grandchildren, Muhammad Mahdi (AS), will come to spread justice through the earth just as it had been filled with injustice. Mahdi (AS) will be from the Naksibendi Way, as stated by Mujaddid Alf-Thani Imam Ahmad Faruk al-Sirhindi (KS), who said: “We have been inspired that Hazrat Mahdi (AS) will be in this nisbat (Way) of ours.”</p><p class="frequent-questions-haead"></p></div></div></div></div></div>
